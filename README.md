Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================

*Author*: Felipe Montefuscolo

Quick usage: ./run.sh

This code is structured as suggested by Insight team:

  ├── README.md  
  ├── run.sh  
  ├── src  
  │   └── count.cpp
  ├── tweet-input  
  │   └── tweets.txt  
  └── tweet-output  
      ├── ft1.txt  
      └── ft2.txt  

The file ft1.txt contains the word counting and the file ft2.txt contains the median.

The code was implemented in C++, and it is simple, fast and scalable.

Thanks to Insight team for giving me this opportunity.
