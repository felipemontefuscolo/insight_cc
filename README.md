Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
===========================================================


## Challenge Summary


1. Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
2. Calculate the median number of *unique* words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in. 

For example, suppose the following three tweets come in, one after the other

- is #bigdata finally the answer to end poverty? @lavanyarathnam http://ow.ly/o8gt3  #analytics  
- interview: xia wang, astrazeneca on #bigdata and the promise of effective healthcare #kdn http://ow.ly/ot2uj  
- big data is not just for big business. on how #bigdata is being deployed for small businesses: http://bddy.me/1bzukb3  @cxotodayalerts #smb  

* *How will the coding challenge be evaluated?*  
Generally, we will evaluate your coding challenge with a testing suite that provides a variety of input tweets and checks the corresponding output.  This suite will attempt to use your 'run.sh' and is fairly tolerant to different output formats.  Of course, there are many aspects that cannot be tested by our suite, so each submission will be reviewed by a person as well. 

* *How long will it take for me to hear back from you about my submission?*  
We receive hundreds of submissions and try to evaluate them all in a timely manner.  We try to get back to all applicants within two or three weeks of submission, but if you have a specific deadline that requires expedited review, you may email us at info@insightdataengineering.com.
